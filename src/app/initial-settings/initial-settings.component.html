  <span>All settings apply same rules! They differ only in visualization. </span>
  <h4>general rules</h4>
  <p>There are 3 'cups' and players throw cards into these cups.</p>
  <p>Game ends when one player is out of cards.</p>
  <p>Each card is worth one point.</p>

  <h4>cards rules</h4>
  <p>If you throw in card which beats current card in cup (rock beats scissors), then this new card becomes dominant and
    its point value equals to all cards it dominates +1.</p>
  <p>If you throw in card which looses to current card in cup (scissors looses to rock), then the winning card remains
    being dominant card and its point value increases by 1.</p>
  <p>If you throw a card which is same as current card in cup (scissors and scissors), then the player of current
    dominant card scores points equal to dominant card's value and new card becomes dominant.</p>

  <h4>evaluation rules</h4>
  <p>Each cup is evaluated separately.</p>
  <p>The player with higher score in one cup wins the cup.</p>
  <p>Player who wins more cups, wins the game.</p>
  @if (selectedMode === 'tutorial') {
    <span>Helps visualize the dominant cards and their point value. Dominant card is always shown on top (even it was thrown in past).</span>
  } @else if (selectedMode === 'advanced') {
    <span>Helps visualize the dominant cards. Dominant card is always shown on top (even it was thrown in past).</span>
  } @else {
    <span>No help - you have to remember, which card is dominant.</span>
